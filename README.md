# Bank Customer Segmentation

This project demonstrates customer segmentation for a bank using unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The analysis is performed on a dataset of banking customers, with the goal of identifying distinct customer segments based on their financial behaviors and characteristics.

## Project Structure
- `Bank Customer Segmentation.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all code, analysis, and visualizations.
- `Bank_data.csv`: Dataset from Kaggle used for analysis. 

## Workflow Overview
1. **Import Libraries and Data**: Load required Python libraries and the customer dataset. Try '!pip install' if the module of the librarie is not found.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze data structure, handle missing values, detect outliers, and visualize distributions.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Examine relationships between variables using a correlation matrix.
4. **Data Standardization**: Standardize features for clustering.
5. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - Apply K-Means to segment customers.
   - Visualize cluster centroids and interpret segment characteristics.
6. **Cluster Insights**: Summarize the main features and behaviors of each customer segment.
7. **Prediction**: Assign cluster labels to each customer and analyze segment distribution.
8. **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**: Reduce data to principal components for visualization.
9. **Cluster Visualization**: Display clusters in principal component space.
10. **Conclusion**: Discuss the business value of customer segmentation for banks.

## Key Technologies

## Correlation matrix

<img width="1187" height="1107" alt="Correlation Matrix" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d43fb726-6c49-4b3c-a606-d1c4d2d910e5" />

From the correlation matrix above, we can observe the following:

The variable 'PURCHASES' is highly correlated with the variables 'PAYMENTS', 'PURCHASES_TRX', 'ONEOFF_PURCHASES_FREQUENCY', 'INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES', and 'ONEOFF_PURCHASES'.

The variable 'CASH_ADVANCE' is correlated with the variables 'PAYMENTS', 'CASH_ADVANCE_TRX', 'CASH_ADVANCE_FREQUENCY', and 'BALANCE'.

## Elbow method

The Elbow Method is a popular technique used to determine the optimal number of neighbors (k) in the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

✨ Purpose
To find the value of k that balances bias and variance for best model performance.

Helps avoid underfitting (low k) and overfitting (high k).

🧪 How it Works
Train the KNN model for a range of k values (e.g. k=1 to 20).

Calculate the error rate (e.g. mean squared error or classification error) for each k.

Plot the error vs. k:

X-axis: Number of neighbors (k)

Y-axis: Error rate

Look for the 'elbow' point in the plot:

This is the point where the error rate starts to flatten or decrease slowly.

It marks a good trade-off: adding more neighbors doesn’t improve performance significantly.

<img width="597" height="455" alt="Elbow method" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbb92243-80ba-4647-b2d9-18a4b25542e8" />

At this point, we can notice an elbow in the inertia graph when the number of clusters is 4.Therefore, the optimal number of clusters appears to be 4.

## PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)

🎯 Purpose of PCA
Reduce the number of features in a dataset.

Identify key directions (principal components) where data varies the most.

Improve computational efficiency and model performance.

📊 Cumulative Explained Variance Plot
This plot helps determine how many principal components to keep by showing the cumulative variance each component contributes.

🔍 How It Works
PCA computes a set of principal components ranked by how much variance they capture.

For each component, calculate the explained variance ratio.

Plot cumulative explained variance:

X-axis: Number of components

Y-axis: Total variance explained (in percentage)

📌 Interpreting the Plot
The curve rises as more components are added.

Look for the ‘elbow’ point—where the curve starts flattening.

This point indicates that adding more components yields diminishing returns in explaining variance.

✅ Best Practice
Choose the number of components just before the curve levels off.

This preserves most of the meaningful data variance while reducing dimensions.

<img width="567" height="455" alt="Cumulative Explained Variance Plot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad98a36c-fe00-4c81-bf45-35ecb33ede65" />

Following this chart, we can see that it’s advisable to work with two principal components, since PC1 contributed 27% and PC2 contributed 20% to the total variance. After that, the further you go, the smaller the contribution to overall variance becomes.

## Scatter Plot of Clusters in Principal Component Space

This visualization displays how the identified clusters are distributed across the space defined by the principal components.

It helps reveal separation, overlap, and structure among the clusters in reduced dimensions.

## Conclusion

By applying machine learning techniques, it is possible to achieve effective categorization of banking customers, enabling a deeper understanding of their behaviors and needs. This segmentation provides a clearer view of the customer base, making it easier to personalize marketing strategies, identify opportunities for product and service improvement, and support more informed business decision-making. In summary, customer segmentation is a powerful tool for any organization in the modern era, allowing for more agile adaptation to changing market demands and delivering a more satisfying experience for customers.
